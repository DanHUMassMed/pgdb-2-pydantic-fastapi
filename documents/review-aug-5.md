# Code Review: `pg_scaffold`

This review covers the Python code in the `src/pg_scaffold` directory, focusing on best practices, potential improvements, and adherence to FastAPI and SQLAlchemy conventions.

## General Observations

The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between the command-line interface, the code generators, and the templates. The use of a metadata-driven approach is a solid foundation for this kind of scaffolding tool.

## `src/pg_scaffold/cli.py`

-   **Suggestion:** Consider using a more modern CLI library like `Typer` or `Click`. These libraries can reduce boilerplate and provide more robust type checking and validation for command-line arguments.
-   **Observation:** The `FriendlyArgumentParser` is a nice touch for improving the user experience on errors.

## `src/pg_scaffold/generator/`

### `base.py`

-   **Suggestion:** The `_load_metadata_from_dir` method could be made more robust by adding error handling for cases where a JSON file is malformed.
-   **Observation:** The `CodeGenerator` abstract base class is well-designed, providing a good structure for the different generator types.

### `inspector.py`

-   **Suggestion:** The `inspect` method could be optimized by fetching all table information (columns, primary keys, foreign keys, indexes) in a more consolidated way, potentially reducing the number of queries to the database.
-   **Best Practice (SQLAlchemy):** Instead of manually building up index and unique column lists, you can directly access this information from the column definitions returned by `inspector.get_columns(table_name)`. The `primary_key`, `unique`, and `index` flags are often available directly on the column dictionary.

### `model_generator.py`

-   **Suggestion:** The `_get_foreign_keys` method is called within the loop in `generate`, which means it's re-calculating the foreign key dictionary for every table. This could be moved outside the loop for a minor performance improvement.
-   **Best Practice (SQLAlchemy):** For relationships, consider adding a `back_populates` argument to the `relationship()` function in the generated models. This will ensure that changes to one side of the relationship are reflected on the other side automatically.

### `utils.py`

-   **Suggestion:** The `map_pg_type_to_sqlalchemy` and `map_pg_type_to_python` functions could be made more comprehensive by including more PostgreSQL data types.
-   **Observation:** The `ensure_package_dirs` function is a useful utility for ensuring the generated code is a valid Python package.

## `src/pg_scaffold/templates/`

### `api.py.j2`

-   **Best Practice (FastAPI):** The `get_db` dependency is defined in each API file. This could be moved to a central `dependencies.py` file to avoid code duplication.
-   **Suggestion:** The `read_one_{{ table_name }}` and `update_{{ table_name }}` endpoints have a hardcoded `_id` suffix in the path parameter. It would be more flexible to derive this from the primary key column name of the table.
-   **Security:** The `delete_{{ table_name }}` endpoint returns the deleted object. While this can be useful, it's also a potential information leak. Consider returning a 204 No Content response instead.

### `crud_base.py`

-   **Best Practice (SQLAlchemy):** The `update` method uses `jsonable_encoder` on the `db_obj`, which can be inefficient. A more direct approach is to iterate over the fields in the Pydantic model and use `setattr` to update the SQLAlchemy model.
-   **Suggestion:** The `filter_multi_like` method is a nice addition for search functionality. However, it's vulnerable to SQL injection if not handled carefully. Using SQLAlchemy's `ilike` is generally safe, but it's worth noting.

### `model.py.j2`

-   **Best Practice (SQLAlchemy):** Consider adding a `__repr__` method to the generated models. This is useful for debugging and logging.
-   **Suggestion:** The template could be enhanced to automatically generate relationships based on the foreign key metadata.

### `schema.py.j2`

-   **Best Practice (Pydantic):** The `Config` class with `from_attributes = True` is correctly used for ORM integration.
-   **Suggestion:** For the `Update` schemas, all fields are optional. This is a good default, but it might be useful to have a way to configure which fields are required for an update.

## Conclusion

Overall, `pg_scaffold` is a well-written and useful tool. The suggestions above are intended to be constructive feedback for potential improvements and are not indicative of any major flaws in the current implementation.
